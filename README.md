## 👋 Hello there

I’m **Vishal** (`@vishal-human`) — a curious builder exploring the world of DevOps and Cloud Computing. This repo is my central space to document, share, and improve everything I’m learning through hands-on projects.

Whether it’s automating things, deploying apps, or just breaking stuff for the sake of understanding — it all ends up here.

---

## 🚀 What's this repo about?

This is not a tutorial repo or a polished product. It’s a workbench — a reflection of my journey into real-world DevOps and cloud tooling.

Each folder contains an individual project or experiment. Some are small, some are complete setups, and some are ongoing works-in-progress.

Feel free to explore, fork, or reach out!
